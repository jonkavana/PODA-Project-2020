    "#####  Structure of the Numpy.Random Package\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle purpose of the package is random number generation, as per [Numpy.org](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html?highlight=numpy%20random#quick-start). Numpy, as per the latest edition of the package, has been updated to include several upgrades in the package. Principle among these, is the introduction of the Permuted Congruential Generator 64 as the default pseudo random number generator. Otherwise known as PCG64, it supports the methods for how random number generation operates [Numpy.Org](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/bit_generators/pcg64.html\\0)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Within it's hierarchail structure, the numpy package is divided into two core parts, *BitGenerators* and *Generators*. \n",
    "We will be at first reviewing the Bitgenerator, via some sample code to demonstrate the packages capabilities.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between th BitGenerator and the Generator allows for random sampling to occur across numerous distributions."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### BitGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the official documentation on the [numpy.org](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.BitGenerator.html#numpy.random.BitGenerator) the bit generator performs a very limited number of tasks within the numpy.random pakage, but that are crucial nonetheless. Amongst these though, is the management of the state as well as functions that will allow for random 32bit and 64bit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BitGenerator creates sequences for the package. These sequences are in turn used by the Generator to sample distrubitons that are being created, such as a Zipf, Binomial and Gaussian distribution. These Distributions will be explained later on in the analysis under Section 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default BitGenerator for the most recent numpy package release is the PCG64. \n",
    "\n",
    "For further information on this, please review [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/bit_generators/pcg64.html#numpy.random.PCG64)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### State & Seeding\n",
    "Now that we understand that the BitGenerator provides a stream of numbers, we need to understand, how seeds are used and facilitate the random number generationm otherwise known as pseudorandom numbers. In order for the BitGenerator to proudce random numbers, it needs to first have it's state initialised by a seed. This process is completed via a process called Seed-Sequence. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Seed Sequence is responsible for setting this initial state. It completes this task, via a process of entropy, which can be reviewed via this [link](https://numpy.org/doc/1.19/reference/random/bit_generators/generated/numpy.random.SeedSequence.html#numpy.random.SeedSequence)."
